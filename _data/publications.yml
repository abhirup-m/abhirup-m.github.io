- title: "Revealing the magnetic dimensional crossover in the Heisenberg ferromagnet CrSiTe$$_3$$ through picosecond strain pulses"
  abstract: "Elucidating the emergence of long-range magnetic ordering from its precursor short-range magnetic ordering (SRMO) in two-dimensional van der Waals materials holds profound implications for fundamental research and technological advancements. However, directly observing the intricate stages of this magnetic dimensional crossover (MDC) remains a significant experimental challenge. While magnetoelastic coupling offers a promising avenue, detecting the minute lattice response to SRMO proves challenging. To meet this goal, we have executed an alternative approach by employing picosecond acoustic strain pulses generated by femtosecond lasers to probe the various stages of MDC through the magnetoelastic coupling. By analyzing the shape of the strain pulse in both the time and frequency domains as a function of temperature, we clearly demonstrate the detection of the subtle influence of spin fluctuations on the lattice. Additionally, the ultrafast carrier dynamics also show signatures of MDC. Our measurements pave the way toward characterizing magnetic materials in time-resolved experiments that are crucial in designing a new generation of spin-based optoelectronic devices."

- title: 'Holographic entanglement renormalisation for fermionic quantum matter: geometrical and topological aspects'
  abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of a holographic dimension in a system of 2D non-interacting Dirac fermions placed on a torus, by studying the scaling of multipartite entanglement measures under a sequence of renormalisation group (RG) transformations applied in momentum space. Geometric measures defined in this emergent space can be related to the RG beta function of the spectral gap, hence establishing a holographic connection between the spatial geometry of the emergent spatial dimension and the entanglement properties of the boundary quantum theory. We prove, analytically, that changing the boundedness of the holographic space involves a topological transition accompanied by a critical Fermi surface in the boundary theory. We go on to show that this results in the formation of a quantum wormhole geometry that connects the UV and the IR of the emergent dimension. The additional conformal symmetry at the transition also supports a relation between the emergent metric and the stress-energy tensor. In the presence of an Aharonov–Bohm flux, the entanglement gains a geometry-independent piece which is shown to be topological, sensitive to changes in boundary conditions, and related to the Luttinger volume of the system. Upon the insertion of a strong transverse magnetic field, we show that the Luttinger volume is linked to the Chern number of the occupied single-particle Landau levels.

- title: 'Kondo frustration via charge fluctuations: a route to Mott localisation'
  abstract: We propose a minimal effective impurity model that captures the phenomenology of the Mott–Hubbard metal–insulator transition of the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions as observed by dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). This involves extending the standard Anderson impurity model Hamiltonian to include an explicit Kondo coupling $$J$$, as well as a local on-site correlation Ub on the conduction bath site connected directly to the impurity. For the case of attractive local bath correlations ($$U_b < 0$$), the extended Anderson impurity model (e-SIAM) sheds new light on several aspects of the DMFT phase diagram. For example, the $$T = 0$$ metal-to-insulator quantum phase transition (QPT) is preceded by an excited state QPT (ESQPT) where the local moment eigenstates are emergent in the low-lying spectrum. Long-ranged fluctuations are observed near both the QPT and ESQPT, suggesting that they are the origin of the quantum critical scaling observed recently at high temperatures in DMFT simulations. The $$T = 0$$ gapless excitations at the quantum critical point display particle-hole interconversion processes, and exhibit power-law behaviour in self-energies and two-particle correlations. These are signatures of non-Fermi liquid behaviour that emerge from the partial breakdown of the Kondo screening.

- title: 'Frustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective'
  abstract: We study the overscreened multi-channel Kondo (MCK) model using the recently developed unitary renormalisation group technique. Our results display the importance of ground state degeneracy in explaining various important properties like the breakdown of screening and the presence of local non-Fermi liquids (NFLs). The impurity susceptibility of the intermediate coupling fixed point Hamiltonian in the zero-bandwidth (or star graph) limit shows a power-law divergence at low temperature. Despite the absence of inter-channel coupling in the MCK fixed point Hamiltonian, the study of mutual information between any two channels shows non-zero correlation between them. A spectral flow analysis of the star graph reveals that the degenerate ground state manifold possesses topological quantum numbers. Upon disentangling the impurity spin from its partners in the star graph, we find the presence of a local Mott liquid arising from inter-channel scattering processes. The low energy effective Hamiltonian obtained upon adding a finite non-zero conduction bath dispersion to the star graph Hamiltonian for both the two and three-channel cases displays the presence of local NFLs arising from inter-channel quantum fluctuations. Specifically, we confirm the presence of a local marginal Fermi liquid in the two channel case, whose properties show logarithmic scaling at low temperature as expected. Discontinuous behaviour is observed in several measures of ground state entanglement, signalling the underlying orthogonality catastrophe associated with the degenerate ground state manifold. We extend our results to underscreened and perfectly screened MCK models through duality arguments. A study of channel anisotropy under renormalisation flow reveals a series of quantum phase transitions due to the change in ground state degeneracy. Our work thus presents a template for the study of how a degenerate ground state manifold arising from symmetry and duality properties in a multichannel quantum impurity model can lead to novel multicritical phases at intermediate coupling.

- title: 'Unveiling the Kondo cloud: unitary RG study of the Kondo model'
  abstract: We analyze the single-channel Kondo model using the recently developed unitary renormalization group (URG) method, and obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Kondo screening cloud. The fixed-point low-energy Hamiltonian enables the computation of a plethora of thermodynamic quantities (specific heat, susceptibility, Wilson ratio, etc.) as well as spectral functions, all of which are found to be in excellent agreement with known results. By integrating out the impurity, we obtain an effective Hamiltonian for the excitations of the electrons comprising the Kondo cloud. This is found to contain both k-space number-diagonal (Fermi liquid) as well off-diagonal four-fermion scattering terms. Our conclusions are reinforced by a URG study of the two-particle entanglement and many-body correlations among members of the Kondo cloud and impurity. The entanglement between the impurity and a cloud electron, as well as between any two cloud electrons, is found to increase under flow towards the singlet ground state at the strong-coupling fixed point. Both the number-diagonal and off-diagonal correlations within the conduction cloud are also found to increase as the impurity is screened under the flow, and the latter are found to be responsible for the macroscopic entanglement of the Kondo-singlet ground state. The unitary RG flow enables an analytic computation of the phase shifts suffered by the conduction electrons at the strong-coupling fixed point. This reveals an orthogonality catastrophe between the local moment and strong-coupling ground states, and is related to a change in the Luttinger volume of the conduction bath. Our results offer fresh insight on the nature of the emergent many-particle entanglement within the Kondo cloud, and pave the way for further investigations in more exotic contexts such as the fixed point of the over-screened multi-channel Kondo problem.
