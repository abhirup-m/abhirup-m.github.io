Anime refers to a specific form of media - hand-drawn or computer-generated animated shows that originate from Japan. Anime differ from western animation productions in various aspects - art style, themes, target audience, etc. Anime have a distinct 2D style that has a particular appeal and that sets it apart from computer generated animation. The themes explored in anime are often very serious, ranging from shows like [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) and [Serial Experiments Lain](https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) that focus on the human psyche and depression, to more modern shows like [Death Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note), [Code Geass](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) and [Attack on Titan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) that deal with topics like racism, genocide and the subjective nature of morality. Some very popular and mainstream anime include Dragon Ball, Pok√©mon and Naruto. 

Here are some moments in various anime series that have become iconic over the years and that portray the depth, intrigue and beauty of storytelling in this form of media. I have restricted myself to one moment per show, for the sake of versatility.
