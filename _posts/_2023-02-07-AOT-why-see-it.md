Hajime Isayama has pulled off something that I am sure all fiction lovers have dreamt of at some point: create a story that gives the impression that everything had been planned out since the very beginning. Complemented by some of the finest musical scores to appear out of the industry, Attack on Titan is a show that leaves you questioning your own moral compass at the end. 

If I had to sell Attack on Titan, I could just spout the usual stuff about insane plot twists, thrilling backstories and engaging characters. While I *do* believe that Attack on Titan (AOT) is one show that embodies all these aspects to their fullest, such a pitch will probably not be that compelling for a random person. Instead, I will point out two specific (and somewhat meta) features of AOT that take the show into a class of its own.

## Taking *Chekov's gun* to the extreme
Chekhov's gun is a narrative principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed. If a writer features a gun in a story, there must be a reason for it, such as it being fired sometime later in the plot. AOT takes this principle to its limit, such that almost every frame in the anime has some purpose which is realised by the viewers, sooner or later. This is a show which does not insult your intelligence in the slightest. No, seriously. Lose focus for a few seconds and you might miss a massive reveal!

## Powerful use of perspective in story telling
Several events in the show are presented repeatedly, but from different perspectives. The initial telling of the event is typically from a certain character's or group's point of view, and is designed to draw the viewers into sympathising with these character(s). A later-in-time telling of the same event from the opposing side then shatters the confidence of the viewer and makes them question their allegiance. This is used from time to time in the show to create a powerful effect where the viewer is able to empathise with all sides in the conflict.

While the story is one of fantasy, the elements of fantasy only serve as metaphors for real world constructs, and the show has deep connections with the very world we live in, through mature and dark themes like racism, nationalism and imperialism. If nothing else, I leave you with the promise that AOT, as a show, is crafted out of utmost love and passion, and that is visible to anyone who watches the show.
