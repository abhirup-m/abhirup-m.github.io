**I will be spoiling the entirety of the anime**. You have been warned.

*I made a similar [post](/aot-foreshadow2/) focusing on Season 1, you might want to check that out.*

AOT is particularly famous among its fans for the insane amount of foreshadowing it has.
Almost all plot twists and major events are hinted at in some way or the other, and seemingly innocent incidents and throwaway comments are found to be related to things that happen in the anime several years down the line (in real time). 
This is my attempt at creating a complete list of all subtle attempts made in the anime towards foreshadowing some major future event. 
The current post focuses on the events of Season 2.

### Episode 1

- **Reiner's reaction when he hears that Wall Rose has been breached**: In the first episode, when Nanaba informs the recruits that titans have appeared inside Wall Rose, Reiner asks Bertholdt "*Has* the wall been breached?!". He is confused as to who would break the wall if they did not.
