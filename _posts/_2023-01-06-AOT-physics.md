Modern day masterpiece *Attack on Titan* (AOT) is undoubtedly *the* most consistent television show I have ever experienced.
Animated by *Wit Studio* and *Studio Mappa*, the show is closely based on *Hajime Isayama*'s manga *Shingeki No Kyojin*.
The anime is set in a post-apocalyptic world where mankind is on the brink of extinction and lives confined within walls in fear of huge humanoid creatures that are referred to as *titans*. The manga was serialised in Bessatsu Sh≈çnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021. The first episode of the anime premiered in April 2013, and is in its fourth and final season as of writing this post. Both the manga and the show have been huge successes, critically as well as commercially, and have won several awards.

AOT is famous for a lot of things, but it does the following three best: insane plot twists, nuanced characters and beautiful music. All three of these devices are used at pivotal points of the show to deliver a powerful experience. 

Because of the elements of fantasy, the world of AOT operates by its own rules which the viewers learn gradually as the show progresses. 

- deterministic
- orthogonal time axes
- instantaneous propagation
- no past or future
- laws of thermodynamics
