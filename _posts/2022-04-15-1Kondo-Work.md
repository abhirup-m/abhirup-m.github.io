The [Kondo model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondo_model) consists of an impurity spin $$\vec S_d$$ interacting with a local conduction bath spin $$\vec S_0$$ through a spin-exchange coupling $$\vec S_d\cdot \vec S_0$$. While it is clear that at high temperatures, the impurity spin remains decoupled from the bath because of thermal spin fluctuations, the behaviour at low temperatures is more non-trivial and required the development of a new framework before the problem was solved.
Indeed, it was only after the development and application of the [numerical renormalisation group method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_renormalization_group) when we realised that the ground state of this model was a macroscopic spin singlet state - an entangled state formed by the impurity spin and the local spin of the conduction bath that couples to the Kondo impurity.

The locking of the impurity spin into a singlet through the quenching of its spin degrees of freedom at low temperatures is analogous to the phenomenon of [colour confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement) that binds quarks to form hadrons at temperatures below the Hagedorn temperature.
While the ground state was known for quite some time, no simple description (effective Hamiltonian) for the [Kondo cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2209) (the set of conduction electrons that form the singlet) was available.
Moreover, the variation of the [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) as the system approached the singlet state was unknown.
Our work sheds light on these topics.
We used the recently developed [unitary renormalisation group method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S055032132030256X) to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the Kondo model at the RG fixed point, and then derived the effective Hamiltonian for the conduction electrons by integrating out the impurity.

Interestingly, a lot of the physics like the ground state, the qualitative nature of screening, certain thermodynamic quantities and universal constants can be obtained from the zero bandwidth limit of the RG fixed point Hamiltonian, which turns out to be just a two-spin Heisenberg model. To obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the excitations, we added a tight-binding hopping into the zero bandwidth model and studied its effects using renormalised perturbation theory about the fixed point. The excitations of the conduction electrons are found to contain both [Fermi liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_liquid_theory) and [non-Fermi liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_liquid_theory#Non-Fermi_liquids) components, the latter arising from the spin-flip fluctuations.

These non-Fermi liquid components are therefore responsible for the quenching of the impurity.
This is further supported by the study of the entanglement and correlations within the Kondo cloud; we find that electrons within the Kondo cloud get entangled more strongly as the system approaches the fixed point, while the spin-spin correlations are also found to increase.
All these are direct signatures of the screening of the impurity.
