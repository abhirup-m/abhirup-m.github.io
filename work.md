The [Kondo model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondo_model) consists of an impurity spin \\(\vec S_d~\\) interacting with a local conduction bath spin \\(\vec S_0~\\) through a spin-exchange coupling \\(\vec S_d\cdot \vec S_0~\\). While it is clear that at high temperatures, the impurity spin remains decoupled from the bath because of thermal spin fluctuations, the behaviour at low temperatures is more non-trivial and required the development of a new framework before the problem was solved.
Indeed, it was only after the development and application of the [numerical renormalization group method](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.47.773) when we realised that the ground state of this model was a macroscopic spin singlet state - an entangled state formed by the impurity spin and the local spin of the conduction bath that couples to the Kondo impurity.
The locking of the impurity spin into a singlet through the quenching of its spin degrees of freedom at low temperatures is analogous to the phenomenon of [colour confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement) that binds quarks to form hadrons at temperatures below the Hagedorn temperature.

While the ground state was known for quite some time, no simple description (effective Hamiltonian) for the [Kondo cloud](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2058-6) (the set of conduction electrons that form the singlet) was available.
Moreover, the variation of the [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) as the system approached the singlet state was unknown.
Our work sheds light on these topics.
We used the recently developed [unitary renormalisation group method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S055032132030256X) to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the Kondo model at the RG fixed point, and then derived the effective Hamiltonian for the conduction electrons by integrating out the impurity.

- The conduction electrons are seen to have both Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid components, the latter arising from the spin-flip fluctuations. 
These non-Fermi liquid components are therefore responsible for the quenching of the impurity.

- This is further supported by the study of the entanglement and correlations within the Kondo cloud; it is seen that electrons within the Kondo cloud get entangled more strongly as the system approaches  the fixed point, while the spin-spin correlations are also found to increase.
All these are direct signatures of the screening phenomenon.
