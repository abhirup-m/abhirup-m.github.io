## Overview

I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on **strongly correlated fermionic systems**. Strong correlation refers to interaction that cannot be expressed purely in terms of single-particle scattering. One of the most popular mathematical models of strong electronic correlation is the Hubbard model - it consists of electrons hopping across a lattice, but each site has a repulsion term that makes it energetically costly for the site to be doubly occupied. This roughly means that each electron will be able to "feel" the presence of other electrons.

The fact that the electrons have to account for the presence of the other electrons is what makes this a **complicated many-body problem** - its not possible to solve for a single electron without also considering the effect of all the other electrons.
I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter ([EPQM](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~slal/index.html)) group. The group's work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others. Other topics of research in the group involve studying the nature of entanglement in gapped (topologically ordered) as well gapless states of matter.

## Specific research interests

- **Quantum impurity models** and phase transitions within them

- Using **auxiliary models** for studying emergence in fermionic systems

- Emergence in **heavy fermion** systems via lattice impurity models

- **Entanglement**, topology and other properties of metallic systems

- Renormalisation group in the context of **optimization** problems

- **Quantum hall systems** and other topologically states of matter
