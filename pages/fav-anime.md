Anime refers to a specific form of media - hand-drawn or computer-generated animated shows that originate from Japan. Anime differ from western animation productions in various aspects - art style, themes, target audience, etc. Anime have a distinct 2D style that has a particular appeal and that sets it apart from computer generated animation. The themes explored in anime are often very serious, ranging from shows like [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) and [Serial Experiments Lain](https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain) that focus on the human psyche and depression, to more modern shows like [Death Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note), [Code Geass](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) and [Attack on Titan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) that deal with topics like racism, genocide and the subjective nature of morality. Some very popular and mainstream anime include Dragon Ball, Pok√©mon and Naruto.
