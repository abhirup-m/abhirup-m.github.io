## Broad Research Area
I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on **strongly correlated fermionic systems**. Strong correlation refers to interaction that cannot be expressed purely in terms of single-particle scattering. I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter ([EPQM](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~slal/index.html)) group. The group's work involves studying correlated fermionic and spin models and obtaining novel emergent states of matter such as superconductivity, non-Fermi liquids, etc.

## More Specifically...

- **Quantum impurity models** and phase transitions within them, with particular emphasis on universal behaviour near Kondo breakdown, and **non-Fermi liquid behaviour** about such points.

- Using **auxiliary models** for studying emergence in lattice models of strong-correlation such as Hubbard-like models and lattice impurity models, focusing on metal-insulator transitions arising from repulsion.

- Topological properties and entanglement of gapless systems, particularly in the context of holography.

- **Quantum hall systems** and other topologically active states of matter.
