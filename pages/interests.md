- **Quantum impurity models** and phase transitions within them
- Using **auxiliary models** for studying emergence in fermionic systems
- Emergence in **heavy fermion** systems via lattice impurity models
- **Entanglement**, topology and other properties of metallic systems
- Renormalisation group in the context of **optimization** problems
- **Quantum hall systems** and other topologically states of matter

To get a more detailed idea of the topics I am interested in, please take a look at my [research work](/research/).
