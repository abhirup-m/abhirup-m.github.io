My name is Abhirup Mukherjee. 
I live in Kalyani, West Bengal, India.
I am a research scholar at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}.
I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, and am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter ([EPQM](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~slal/index.html){:target="\_blank"}) group. We apply analytical and (sparingly) numerical methods to problems of interacting fermions or quantum spins, and study various questions of emergence, topological order and many-particle entanglement. We also work on the development of new analytical and numerical techniques for working on such problems, such as a renormalisation group method, an entanglement renormalisation group program, and an auxiliary model method. Potential future goals include looking into optimisation problems from the perspective of renormalisation group flows.

When I am not working, I enjoy watching [anime](https://myanimelist.net/featured/1382/What_is_Anime){:target="\_blank"}, reading books, dabbling in open-source software and [ricing my desktop](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary#wiki_rice){:target="\_blank"}. I am also part of an organisation named [Projectyl](https://www.facebook.com/projectyl.in){:target="\_blank"} that helps undergraduate and graduate students in finding and applying for short projects and internships in India, with the goal of making it easier for them to transition into their research programs.
