## {{ page.title }}

This is a very short introduction to the philosophy and algorithm of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). I brought these points together and wrote this up mostly to cement my own understanding of the topic. I first discuss the Curie-Weiss mean field theory in the context of the Ising model in order to provide a familiar language, and set up in a slightly different way so that it is easily generalised to DMFT. This might be useful for anyone wanting to know, in brief, what DMFT is, and how it is implemented.
