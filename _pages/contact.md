- You can always send me [emails <i class="fas fa-envelope-square"></i>](mailto:mukherjeeabhirup444@gmail.com){: target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"} for any sort of communication, request or recommendation.
- You can also reach out to me on [Facebook <i class="fab fa-facebook"></i>](https://www.facebook.com/Seary.Blue){: target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"} or [LinkedIn <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhirup-mukherjee-665588229){: target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"}. Please keep in mind, though, that I am not very active on those platforms.
- If you are interested, you can also check out my hobby projects and the numerical parts of my research on [Github <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/abhirup-m){: target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"}.
- Feel free to check out our work at [Projectyl](https://www.facebook.com/projectyl.in) if you are interested in landing a summer or winter project in physics. Hit me up if you want to be a part of the group.
