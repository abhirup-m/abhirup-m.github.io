## {{ page.title }}

This is a re-working of R. Rajaraman's demonstration that the tight-binding dispersion can be obtained by treating the problem of electrons moving in a periodic potential in terms of instantons. This has the advantage that the crystal momentum can be identified as a topological winding number.
