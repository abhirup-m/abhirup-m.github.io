## {{ page.title }}

This is an expansion of R. Shankar's derivation (Shankar, 1993) of the Landau Fermi liquid effective Hamiltonian and its possible BCS instability by applying the renormalization group technique on a general 2D interacting fermionic system with a circular Fermi surface. I have added a short introduction to the philosophy of renormalisation group. Certain non-trivial arguments and calculations have also been fleshed out. Where possible, certain parts have been simplified.
