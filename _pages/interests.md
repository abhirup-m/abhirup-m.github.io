## Overview

I am conducting my doctoral research work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on the studies of electronic systems with **strong correlations**. Strong correlation refers to interaction that cannot be expressed purely in terms of single-particle scattering. One of the most popular mathematical models of strong electronic correlation is the Hubbard model - it consists of electrons hopping across a lattice, but each site has a repulsion term that makes it energetically costly for the site to be doubly occupied. This roughly means that each electron will be able to "feel" the presence of other electrons - through this extremely localised Coulomb repulsion. The fact that the electrons have to account for the presence of the other electrons is what makes this a **complicated many-body problem** - its not possible to solve for a single electron.

I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter ([EPQM](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~slal/index.html)) group. The group's work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others. Other topics of research in the group involve studying the nature of entanglement in gapped (topologically ordered) as well gapless states of matter.

## Interests

- **Impurity models** and phase transitions therein
- Use of **auxiliary models** in studying emergence in systems of strong correlation
- **Entanglement**, topology and other properties of Fermi liquids
- Emergence in **heavy fermion** systems described by periodic impurity models
- **Quantum hall** and other topologically active systems
- Relation between renormalisation group and **optimization** problems

Below is a list of the projects I have been involved in (complete as well as ongoing) to give a more detailed picture of my research interests. 

## Ongoing Projects

### [Luttinger volume as a function of a flux-dependent mutual information](/work/#lutt-th)

In the presence of a vector potential that pierces a system placed on a torus, the entanglement entropy becomes a function of the flux, and the point here is to relate this entanglement measure to the Luttinger volume (number of \\(k-\\)space points inside the Fermi volume).

### [A new auxiliary model approach to studying fermionic systems of strong correlation](/work/#aux)

This is an attempt to create an analytical formalism that leverages the power of a unitary renormalisation group and auxiliary models to study strongly-correlated systems with translation symmetry.

### [A minimal impurity model for metal-insulator transition](/work/#imp-mit)

This project involves the search for a minimal impurity model that shows a phase transition. 

## Complete Projects

### [Frustration shapes multi-channel Kondo physics: a star graph perspective](/work/#mckondo)

This is a study of the multichannel Kondo model using the unitary RG and entanglement RG methods to extract the effect of quantum frustration on impurity screening in particular and the low-energy impurity physics in general.

### [**Unveiling the Kondo cloud: Unitary renormalization-group study of the Kondo model**](/work/#kondo){:link}

Here we solved the single-channel Kondo impurity model using the unitary RG formalism to obtain the low-energy state of the impurity and of the conduction electrons that scatter against the impurity.
