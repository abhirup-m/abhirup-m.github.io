### Overview

I am conducting my doctoral research work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on the studies of electronic systems with **strong correlations**. Strong correlation refers to interaction that cannot be expressed purely in terms of single-particle scattering. One of the most popular mathematical models of strong electronic correlation is the Hubbard model - it consists of electrons hopping across a lattice, but each site has a repulsion term that makes it energetically costly for the site to be doubly occupied. This roughly means that each electron will be able to "feel" the presence of other electrons - through this extremely localised Coulomb repulsion. The fact that the electrons have to account for the presence of the other electrons is what makes this a **complicated many-body problem** - its not possible to solve for a single electron.

I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter ([EPQM](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~slal/index.html)) group. The group's work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others. Other works in the group involve studying the $$N-$$partite mutual information of topologically ordered states of matter.

### Interests

- phase transitions in impurity models
- emergence in heavy Fermion systems described by periodic impurity models
- auxiliary model approach to studying emergence in systems of strong correlation
- quantum hall and other topologically active systems
- relation between renormalisation group and optimization problems
