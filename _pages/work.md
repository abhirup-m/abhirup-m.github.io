## Overview

I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on **strongly correlated fermionic systems**. Strong correlation refers to interaction that cannot be expressed purely in terms of single-particle scattering. One of the most popular mathematical models of strong electronic correlation is the Hubbard model - it consists of electrons hopping across a lattice, but each site has a repulsion term that makes it energetically costly for the site to be doubly occupied. This roughly means that each electron will be able to "feel" the presence of other electrons.

The fact that the electrons have to account for the presence of the other electrons is what makes this a **complicated many-body problem** - its not possible to solve for a single electron without also considering the effect of all the other electrons.
I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter ([EPQM](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~slal/index.html)) group. The group's work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others. Other topics of research in the group involve studying the nature of entanglement in gapped (topologically ordered) as well gapless states of matter.

## Specific research interests

- **Quantum impurity models** and phase transitions within them

- Using **auxiliary models** for studying emergence in fermionic systems

- Emergence in **heavy fermion** systems via lattice impurity models

- **Entanglement**, topology and other properties of metallic systems

- Renormalisation group in the context of **optimization** problems

- **Quantum hall systems** and other topologically states of matter

## Master's thesis work

A short abstract of my master's research work and the thesis itself can be found [here](/ms-thesis/). I studied an extended Anderson impurity model using an analytical non-perturbative renormalisation group method.

## Informal write-ups

These are some casual documents I have prepared on various topics while learning them, either for courses I was attending or for my tutor assistantships. They might be helpful as very quick introductions or as an opinionated conglomeration of the ideas of certain topics.

[**The tight-binding model on the 2D square lattice**](/phys_note_tbm/): This is a quick introduction to the tight-binding problem on a 2D square lattice. I describe how it can be obtained from a more general model, its solution and some of its important properties like the isoenergetic contours and van Hove singularities.

[**Topological significance of the crystal momentum**](/phys_note_bloch/): This is a re-working of R. Rajaraman's demonstration that the tight-binding dispersion can be obtained by treating the problem of electrons moving in a periodic potential in terms of instantons. This has the advantage that the crystal momentum can be identified as a topological winding number.

[**R. Shankar's RG derivation for Landau Fermi liquid and BCS instability**](/phys_note_RG/): This is an expansion of R. Shankar's derivation (Shankar, 1993) of the Landau Fermi liquid effective Hamiltonian and its possible BCS instability by applying the renormalization group technique on a general 2D interacting fermionic system with a circular Fermi surface. I have added a short introduction to the philosophy of renormalisation group. Certain non-trivial arguments and calculations have also been fleshed out. Where possible, certain parts have been simplified.

[**Lightning-quick introduction to single site dynamical mean field theory**](/phys_note_dmft/): This is a very short introduction to the philosophy and algorithm of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). I brought these points together and wrote this up mostly to cement my own understanding of the topic. I first discuss the Curie-Weiss mean field theory in the context of the Ising model in order to provide a familiar language, and set up in a slightly different way so that it is easily generalised to DMFT. This might be useful for anyone wanting to know, in brief, what DMFT is, and how it is implemented.
